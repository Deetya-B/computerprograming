     World War II, a global conflict lasting from 1939 to 1945, involved the vast majority of the 
     world's countries, forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers.
     The main Allied powers were Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China,
     while the Axis powers were primarily Germany, Italy, and Japan. The war resulted in an 
     unprecedented level of destruction and loss of life, with an estimated 70 to 85 million 
     fatalities, making it the deadliest conflict in human history.

    The causes of World War II have been given considerable attention by historians. The immediate 
    precipitating event was the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany on September 1, 1939, and the 
    subsequent declarations of war on Germany made by Britain and France, but many other prior 
    events have been suggested as ultimate causes. Primary themes in historical analysis of the 
    war's origins include the political takeover of Germany in 1933 by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi 
    Party; Japanese militarism against China, which led to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and 
    the Second Sino-Japanese War; Italian aggression against Ethiopia, which led to the 
    Second Italo-Ethiopian War; or military uprising in Spain, which led to the Spanish Civil War.

    The Invasion of Poland, also known as the September Campaign or Polish Defensive War, began on
    September 1, 1939, marking the start of World War II. Nazi Germany invaded Poland from the 
    north, west, and south, with the Soviet Union invading from the east on September 17. The 
    invasion led to the defeat and partition of Poland by the two powers.
